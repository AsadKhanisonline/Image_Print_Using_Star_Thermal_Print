# Image_Print_Using_Star_Thermal_Print
 love to share with you the simple code for Star printer to easily print the images. Mainly I used it for Point Of Sales. In my case, I used many libraries to print images and text on Star Printer, and their configuration was hard for me to do. So I provide you an easy solution to print bitmap using the Star on thermal printer. Point of sale POS thermal printer

 The libraries provided on Github do not support the printing text/images on Star printer, to print text or images, firstly draw text and images on Bitmap using Canvas in android studio. Alignment of text format using other methods is hard. Canvas allows you to draw text using specified locations and also can perform many operations including text size increase and decrease, text bold, and image set at any location.
 For the Point Of Sales slip generated, Canvas is a good approach. Use embed this code and print the Bitmap on Start Thermal Printers.
